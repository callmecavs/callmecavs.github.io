But I&apos;d prefer if you called me Cavs. I&apos;m a developer, and a simple man - simple enough for one name, and a couple trusty pairs of shorts. Creating, and creativity, have always been my passion. I believe in meaning over metrics, and love crafting experiences that leave an impact, that leave people feeling some kinda way. I live for the late nights, for pressure making diamonds, for never compromising, for being fearless and confident in the face of ambition versus reality. I write simple code, backed by complex principles, that will get out of your way, and leave you fascinated by the experience.</p>
